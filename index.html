Originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo, I moved to America in 2017 to pursue a degree in computer science. I am currently a junior, and have been able to gather some work experience through internships and jobs both prior to and while going to Lcsc. My greatest strength I would say is my determination that causes me to work harder than most people are willing to. One thing that I am currently working to Improve is my time management skills. I have yet to come up with one that works well.

    <h2>Interests
      
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since a really young age, I have always been really interested in sports and technology. I started like most people with biking, and I loved going to remote places with my friends to ride our bikes and try new tricks. Then came the era of cars, I loved cars and had many toys. Around age 10, I develloped a passion for body building and contact sports such as boxing and karate. But since my parents were against violence, I ended up staying home and learning how to use computers. Soon enough, I was that person everyone called when they needed help with their computers. Then I started playing video games around age 13. With time and practice I was participating in gaming competitions. Then came school and other responsibility came along and I started develloping a particular Interest for subjects such as Biology and chemistry very eary, as both my parents and 3 out of four of my grandparents are medical corps. Going into High School, I chose Biochemistry as my major and very much enjoyed every second of learning those subjects. Till this day I am still passionate about sports, computers and the other Interests I had from a young age, just differently.

      Education
    </h2>
    <button class="accordion">Bachelor's Of Science, Lewis-Clark State College</button>
  <article class="panel">
      <p>
        After Going to Colege for Two year at the Protestant University of Congo, I traveled to the United States of America to further my education. I left friends and family behind to engage in a perillous lonely adventure that was intimidating.
        Upon arriving at Lewiston In Idaho, I was conditionally accepted to Lewis-Clark State College, If I was able to learn english and be fluent enough to attend an American college.
        I thus started at the Institute of Intensive English(IIE). Initially expected to spend 3 semesters to achieve the needed proof of profficiency, I completed the program in only three fourth of the semester and was able to attend college Fall 2017. I received the certificate, and was given a choice. stay for one more semester and improve on my skills or take college on with brushwhood legs. I chose to take my chance, at which point I was faced with the choice of a major. After studying Business administration for two years, i was not convinved. I had a second chance, which is rare, and I was going to take full advantage of it. after thinking about it, I chose to major in Computer Science. Which I really much enjoyed and excelled at. I studied at Lewis-Clark State College for 4 years, and graduated with my Bachelor degree May of 2020.

      <p>
        After High School I wanted to spread my wings and discover something else than science. So I picked Business Administration as my major. I chose Business Administration, because I wanted to start a buisiness of my own. In fact my mom and I had made a complete Buisiness plan for a non-governmental organization, to help widows, orphans and homeless kids. So I tried thought I would learn Important skills to push us further towards the realization of our goals. I did learn a lot in the two years I spent studying, but I did not feel like I was learning what I was looking for. Despite my good grades, I wasn't interested in pursuing a carreer in Business administration. I wanted to make my own not manage someone else's. towards the end of my second year, I got offered a scholarship to study at Lewis-Clark State College in Lewiston Idaho in the United states, and I seized my chance to start anew.

    <button class="accordion">High-School Diploma, Complex Scolaire La Borne</button>
    <article class="panel">
      <p>
        I graduated High-School with a diploma in Bio-Chemistry from the CS La Borne in Kinshasa, Democratique Republique of Congo. I loved biology and chemistry, mostly because most my family tree is composed in majority or medical corps who would crame medical terms and concepts in our heads from a yound age. I started reading the neuro-surgery books that my dad would leave lingering on a table or a shelf, watch documentaries or ask question to learn more. I was immerged in the world of biology and chemistry. Much so, that before I went to High-School, I used to be invited to compete for the school against other schools High-School seniors. I excelled in biology and chemistry, and loved every second of my time in High-School.
