    <h1 class="title is-primary is-4">Why am I seeking an Internship?</h1>
    <main class="grid-x grid-padding-x">
        <p>
            Throughout my life, more specifically Throughout my three years at Lewis-Clark State College, I have come to meet some people, face some challenges, or see someone doing so interesting I got curious. All these little opportunities that I have seized have brought me where I am and made me who I am. But Who am I? Good Question. I am a multi langual software engineer to be, with a taste for medicine, sports and music. But we are not here to talk about the latter so let's get to what I have to offer as a software engineer. 

        </p>
        <p>
            I have learned to code in multiple languages, and have taught or tutored in swift, python and C++ mainly. I have developed a good understanding of computers, computers process and Algorithm, ressource management (mainly memory) and different coding styles and their benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using Languages such as C++, Python and Java helped me grasp most concepts related to Object oriented programming. Knowledge that I have worked to polish through several projects, reading as well as trial and error. Thanks to my teacher's challenges and the countless youtubers who freely share their Knowledge, I am now able to tackle bigger challenges related to object oriented programming or any other computer related problem I come accross.
        </p>
        <p>
            Which brings me to my point, why I am looking for an Internship? I have all these cool skills that I am proud of, but I am not naive. I yet have a lot to learn to get where I need to be as a software engineer. After looking at what skill sets are needed to get the Internship I wanted, I realised school is just the foundation upon which each one needs to add their own skill set. So researched more and more everytime I saw a qualification I did not have. I learned enough to be capable and moved on to the next, accasionally revisiting what I have learned. "A muscle that is not used atrophies and dies". The same goes for skills, If you do not use them they fade away. which is why I am seeking an Internship. To learn more and put my skills to a bigger purpose. To share my humble Knowledge and learn from those who I encounter on my journey. here is a brief summary of my skill set.
